/* vault_capability.h: the vault:write:server capability grants store (P2/D2c).
 *
 * A server-principal credential is autonomously decryptable by every delegate, so
 * the power to WRITE one (a CLIENT-SUPPLIED secret landing in the server vault —
 * e.g. `agent add --key` or `vault set --server`) must not be conferred by the
 * transport bearer alone. This module is a tiny operator-managed allow-list of
 * attested principals (uid:<n> / webuser:<name>) that hold vault:write:server. The
 * server-principal write gate consults it alongside an attested-transport check
 * (D2b: UDS_PEERCRED / WEBCHAT_TRUSTED only). NOTE: server-OBTAINED secrets (the
 * codex / OAuth tokens the server itself fetched) are NOT gated by this — only
 * client-supplied injections are.
 *
 * Grants are minted only over a kernel-attested UDS connection and stored in a
 * 0600 file under <config>/.vault/; the store is process-safe (mutex). */
