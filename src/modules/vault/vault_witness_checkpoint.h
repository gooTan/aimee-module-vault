/* P7-witness-e1: signed checkpoint format, verification, and continuity verdict.
 *
 * A checkpoint commits to every shard head at an instant via the SMT root
 * (vault_witness_merkle). It is signed under a vault-held key and verified offline
 * by a consumer holding only the emitted bytes plus an out-of-band trust anchor —
 * never a key fetched from the emitting host, which an attacker also controls.
 *
 * Verification is a pure function over bytes plus the anchor set: it never
 * consults a database, so a compromised database cannot influence the verdict.
 * Continuity (does this checkpoint link to the one before it) is a SEPARATE
 * verdict from validity, because emission gaps are normal, not tampering.
 *
 * E1 defines the format and the verify/continuity entry points; E2 owns the
 * cadence, the fenced signer, and persist-before-emit. This module is pure and
 * production-uninvoked in E1.
