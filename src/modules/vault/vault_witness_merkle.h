/* P7-witness-e1: sparse Merkle tree over shard heads for the signed checkpoint.
 *
 * The commitment is an SMT of fixed depth 64, keyed by the leading 8 bytes of
 * SHA-256 over the packed shard key (see vault_witness_shard_key_hash). Fixed
 * topology means advancing one shard touches one root-to-leaf path and proofs are
 * stable; a shallower key would let two shards share a leaf, which would let one
 * tenant's head stand in for another's. Empty subtrees have precomputed constant
 * hashes per level and are never materialized, so a root over N occupied leaves
 * costs O(N * depth), not O(2^64).
 *
 * Pure and production-uninvoked in E1: no database, no I/O, no scheduler.
