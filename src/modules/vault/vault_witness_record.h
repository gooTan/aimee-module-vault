/* P7-witness-e1: canonical witness-record wire format and digest.
 *
 * A witness record is the *evidence* of one source-ledger event (an audit-chain
 * append, a reseal rewrap event, or a D3b open event) — never the audited
 * payload, never any key material. Its digest binds the complete logical event
 * so a copy retained off-host can be compared byte-for-byte against the local
 * store. A bug in encoding or digesting produces evidence that looks well-formed
 * locally yet is worthless for comparison, so the format is fixed here, matched
 * by the SQL side (`src/db2/schema.sql`), and pinned by stored test vectors.
 *
 * This module is pure and production-uninvoked in E1: it has no database, no I/O,
 * and is not reachable from admission, the reseal orchestrator, or any route.
