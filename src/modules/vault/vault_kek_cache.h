/* vault_kek_cache: the RAM-only, principal-keyed key-encryption-key cache for the
 * credential vault (WP-C.1, D14). The KEK is derived once per unlock (CLI) or
 * login (webchat) and held here so per-delegate credential decrypts don't need
 * the client root key / password again.
 *
 * Why a purpose-built cache instead of the forge_credentials broker (D14): that
 * broker is a NUL-terminated *string* store (truncates a binary KEK at the first
 * 0x00) and has only 64 slots with evict-on-full. This cache holds the RAW
 * 32-byte KEK byte-exact, is keyed by the attested PRINCIPAL string (never a
 * client-supplied session_id), and is **reject-don't-evict** when full so a burst
 * of unlocks can never silently evict an in-use KEK. It copies the broker's
 * discipline: RAM only (never to disk, never logged), OPENSSL_cleanse on every
 * eviction/expiry/clear, TTL'd, and mutex-guarded.
 *
 * Time is passed in (now_epoch) so the TTL is testable without a real clock. */
